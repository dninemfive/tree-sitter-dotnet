# Tree Sitter .NET

C# bindings for [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).

~~Ported from [the Java implementation](https://github.com/serenadeai/java-tree-sitter), with some reference to [this](https://github.com/profMagija/dotnet-tree-sitter) partial C# implementation.~~

edit: archiving because dotnet-tree-sitter is not only significantly more complete than i thought, it appears to be more a more thorough binding than the Java version.

todo: nuget and stuff
